# RestaurantDatabase

Created an HTML and CSS interface to access and alter a database in a variety of ways. Gives the user several options such as insertions, deletions, selections and access to specific queries unique to the database. The link to the site is: https://cs3319.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/vm142/a3toad/mainmenu.php, however, it may not work as it will be disconnected from the database at the end of the semester, so I have provided screenshots.
